# Lightweight Mobile Friendly Login Form

This is a simple login form built using HTML5. It targets non-responsive browsers (e.g. IE6), then small-screen mobile devices and progressively enhances upwards to fully responsive modern desktop browsers.

Use it as a base to build on or extend it as you please.. 

**Demo: http://thefoot.github.com/lightweight-mobile-loginform/**

**Unit Test: http://thefoot.github.com/lightweight-mobile-loginform/tests/formvalidator.html**

It performs simple required field validation and displays errors inline.

It uses native JavaScript (no JS frameworks), it's object-oriented and un-obtrusive.

Javascript and CSS is combined and minified (uncompressed source in `/js` and `/css` folders).

It weighs in at a total page weight of 33kb, but 10kb on phones (without the background image) - perfect for poor (2G) connection speeds.

Jasmine unit tests included: `/tests/formvalidator.html`
